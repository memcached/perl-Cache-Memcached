	* add run_command API call.  TODO: document, and document
	  the $exptime on the setters
		  
2003-09-30
	* use send instead of print, so we can set MSG_NOSIGNAL
	  and not get SIGPIPES, which avoids 3 syscalls of localizing
	  $SIG{PIPE} and sends everything at once, instead of 4k
	  stdio chunks.  in review:  stdio buffered in, send unbuffered
	  out.  TODO:  setvbuf so reads are buffered at more than 4k.

	* yet faster parsing
	* switch to stdio/perlio instead of raw io: more correct,
	  simpler parsing code.

2003-09-28
	* prevent some warnings
	* faster get() call that doesn't use get_multi()
	* optimizations for single-server case
	* use socket APIs directly, instead of uber-slow IO::* modules
	* new faster _load_items parsing
	
2003-09-04	
	* emit debug when set/add/replace fails, in addition to succeed
