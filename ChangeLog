	* version 1.0.10, rename to Cache::Memcached, upload to CPAN
	
2003-10-18
	* implement read/write timeouts everywhere. Now the client shouldn't
          hang if the server machine goes down unexpectedly. (avva)

2003-10-16
	* use Storable::nfreeze instead of freeze, so hosts from different
	  architectures can all use the same data.  (all must use Perl, though.
	  the different memcache APIs all store/pickle/serialize data differently)
	  Suggestion by Jason Titus <jtitus@postini.com>
	
2003-10-06
	* fix _incrdecr to return complete number, not just first
	  digit (thanks to Ryan T. Dean)
	* release version 1.0.9

2003-10-04
	* document expiration times in POD (thanks to Tim Bunce
	  for noting the omission)
	* release version 1.0.8
	
2003-10-03
	* add connect timeout of 0.25s, for dead host detection.
	  We had 1 second a couple revs ago, but lost it when
	  ditching IO::Socket module.  (avva)
	
2003-10-02
	* fix _incrdecr with explicit-hashvalue keys (whitaker)
	
2003-10-01
	* add run_command API call.  TODO: document, and document
	  the $exptime on the setters
		  
2003-09-30
	* use send instead of print, so we can set MSG_NOSIGNAL
	  and not get SIGPIPES, which avoids 3 syscalls of localizing
	  $SIG{PIPE} and sends everything at once, instead of 4k
	  stdio chunks.  in review:  stdio buffered in, send unbuffered
	  out.  TODO:  setvbuf so reads are buffered at more than 4k.

2003-09-29
	* yet faster parsing
	* switch to stdio/perlio instead of raw io: more correct,
	  simpler parsing code.

2003-09-28
	* prevent some warnings
	* faster get() call that doesn't use get_multi()
	* optimizations for single-server case
	* use socket APIs directly, instead of uber-slow IO::* modules
	* new faster _load_items parsing
	
2003-09-04	
	* emit debug when set/add/replace fails, in addition to succeed
      
Version 1.0.7
	-- compression support (Brad Whitaker)
	
Version 1.0.6
	-- incr/decr client support
	-- make delete optionally take second argument (server now supports
	   a delay time on delete)
	-- doc updates from Jamie McCarthy
	-- better hashing after dead host detection:  new requests go to different
	   remaining hosts, instead of all to the same one.

Version 1.0.2
	-- initial release, about.
